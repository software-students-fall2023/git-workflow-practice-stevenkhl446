Summary of the Article

 - Quick Summary: The article discusses the historical context of concerns about AI 
		  replacing software engineers. It hightlights that past programmers
		  were undervalued. However, the author claims that AI, like GHATGPT, 
		  is unlikely to replace engineers' jobs.

 - Interersting point: The article states the historical perspective on attempts to
		       simplify programming. Early efforts, such as introducing
		       programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL, aimed to make
		       coding more accessible and less reliant on skilled programmers.
		       However, these innovations didn't replace programmers but instead
		       added complexity to the field, ultimately increasing the demand for
		       their expertise.
